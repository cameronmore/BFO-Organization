# Introduction to Basic Formal Ontology

## Origins
Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) was developed primarily by Barry Smith during his work with the Human Genome Project. To capture the vast amounts of data about genes being produced, various teams working independently on different genomic structures began categorizing their data with ontologies,
a human-readable and machine-readable data annotation framework. However, because there was no unifying structure to their ontologies, the tagged data did not align, and silos of genomic data were created. Basic Formal Ontology was insitituded as a common 'upper-level' for all of the lower modules that were beng developed.

## Development
Basic Formal Ontology has had its greatest sucess as the upper-level ontology for the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry. BFO united hundreds of domain ontologies that extend from it, from proteins to zebrafish. The backbone of the OBO Foundry is still the Gene Ontology (GO). Genes have impacts at various 'levels of granularity'--the sub-cellular, cellular, tissue, organ, and organism levels, so other ontologies in the foundry rely on terms from the GO.
