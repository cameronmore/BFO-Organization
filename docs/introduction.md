#Introduction to Basic Formal Ontology

##Background
Basic Formal Ontology was developed primarily by Barry Smith during his work with the Human Genome Project. To capture the vast amounts of data about genes being produced, various teams working independently on different genomic structures began categorizing their data with ontologies,
a human-readable and machine-readable data annotation framework. However, because there was no unifying structure to their ontologies, the tagged data did not align, and silos of genomic data were created. Basic Formal Ontology was insitituded as a common 'upper-level' for all of the lower modules that were beng developed.
