# Basic Formal Ontology

This repository hosts to documents for the [BFO Documentation Site](https://johnbeve.github.io/BFO-Organization/)  The website is built using `mkdocs` and the deployment of the website is controlled using the github action `.github/workflows/build-deploy-documentation.yaml`. The github action has been configured to run if any changes are made to `mkdocs.yaml`, files in the `docs/` or `docs/images/` directories, or after a pull request is merged. This allows to closely track the repository history using pull requests (if desired).
